# NUDRRS: Problem Statement & Impact Analysis
## Smart India Hackathon 2025

### üö® **Problem Definition**

#### **Current Disaster Response Challenges in India**

**1. Information Fragmentation**
- Multiple agencies (NDMA, SDRF, Police, Fire) operate in silos
- No unified platform for citizen reporting and government response
- Critical time lost in information relay between departments

**2. Delayed Response Times**
- Average emergency response time: 15-30 minutes in urban areas, 45+ minutes in rural
- Manual verification of distress calls leads to delays
- Lack of real-time resource tracking and allocation

**3. Communication Barriers**
- Limited multilingual support in emergency systems
- Rural populations struggle with smartphone-based reporting
- No standardized SOS protocol across states

**4. Inadequate Prediction Systems**
- Weather warnings don't translate to actionable evacuation plans
- No integration between meteorological data and ground-level response
- Reactive approach rather than proactive disaster management
