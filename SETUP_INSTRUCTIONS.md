## Database

The system uses SQLite for development (automatically created) and can be configured for PostgreSQL in production.

### Models
- **SOSReport**: Main emergency report model
- **ReportMedia**: Media attachments for reports
- **ReportUpdate**: Status update history

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
1. **Port 8000 in use**: Change port in `run_server.py`
2. **Database errors**: Delete `db.sqlite3` and run migrations again
3. **Admin access**: Use username `admin` and password `admin123`

### Frontend Issues
1. **Port 3000 in use**: React will prompt to use a different port
2. **API connection**: Ensure backend is running on port 8000
3. **CORS errors**: Backend includes CORS headers for development

### Common Commands
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Development Notes

- The system automatically falls back to demo data if the backend is unavailable
- All forms are designed to be compact and user-friendly
- The admin panel includes custom styling and enhanced functionality
- Real-time updates are implemented with automatic refresh intervals
- AI integration is prepared for future enhancement

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Configure PostgreSQL database
2. Set up proper environment variables
3. Use a production WSGI server (Gunicorn)
4. Configure static file serving
5. Set up proper CORS policies
6. Enable HTTPS

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the console logs for error messages
2. Verify all services are running on correct ports
3. Ensure database migrations are up to date
4. Check network connectivity between frontend and backend
